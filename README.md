# Day 6 – Homework

## Objective
To practice using functions and modules in Python and understand how `return` works.

## Homework Tasks

### Task 1: Rectangle Calculation
- Created a function `calc_rectangle(length, width)`
- Calculated:
  - Area
  - Perimeter
- Returned both values from the function
- Took input from the user and displayed the results

### Task 2: Custom Module Creation
- Created a module named `math_operations.py`
- Defined the following functions:
  - `power(base, exp)` to calculate power
  - `average(numbers_list)` to find the average of numbers

### Task 3: Using the Module
- Created `main.py`
- Imported `math_operations` module
- Calculated:
  - Power of 2 raised to 10
  - Average of the list `[10, 20, 30, 40]`

# Day 7 – File Handling in Python

## Objective
To learn how to read and write data using files in Python.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to file handling
- File modes:
  - `r` (read)
  - `w` (write)
  - `a` (append)
- Opening and closing files
- Using `with open()` statement
- Reading data from files
- Writing and appending data to files
- Difference between `w` and `a`
- Basics of Excel file handling using `openpyxl`

## Programs Practiced
- Writing user input (name and daily goal) into a text file
- Appending multiple records to the same file
- Reading and displaying file content
- Understanding overwrite vs append
- Reading data from an Excel file (`student.xlsx`)
- Handling file-related errors

## Learnings / Outcomes
- Learned how to permanently store data using files
- Understood the importance of append mode for logging
- Learned that `with open()` automatically closes files
- Gained basic knowledge of reading Excel files
- Improved understanding of real-world data storage

## Conclusion
Day 7 helped me understand file handling concepts in Python. These concepts are useful for data storage, logging, and file-based applications.

# Day 8 – NumPy Basics and Array Operations

## Objective
To learn the basics of NumPy and perform efficient numerical operations using arrays instead of loops.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to NumPy
- Creating NumPy arrays
- Difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays
- Array attributes (shape, size, dtype)
- Generating arrays using:
  - `np.arange()`
  - `np.linspace()`
- Reshaping arrays
- Broadcasting in NumPy
- Vectorized operations
- Axis-based operations (row-wise and column-wise)

## Programs Practiced
- Creating 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Performing element-wise operations without loops
- Reshaping a 1D array into 2D and 3D arrays
- Normalizing student marks using broadcasting
- Calculating mean and standard deviation using `axis`
- Difference between element-wise multiplication (`*`) and matrix multiplication (`@`)

## Key Learnings / Outcomes
- Learned how NumPy arrays are faster and more efficient than Python lists
- Understood broadcasting and how NumPy handles arrays of different shapes
- Learned to reshape data to match machine learning model requirements
- Gained clarity on axis-based calculations (rows vs columns)
- Improved coding efficiency by replacing loops with vectorized operations

## Conclusion
Day 8 helped me understand the power of NumPy for numerical and data processing tasks. These concepts are very important for data science and machine learning applications.
