# Day 18 — Introduction to Machine Learning

## ✅ What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a method where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

## ✅ Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## ✅ Regression vs Classification

### Regression
- Predicts numerical values
- Example: House price prediction

### Classification
- Predicts categories
- Example: Spam vs Not spam

## ✅ ML Workflow
1. Load dataset
2. Feature and label separation
3. Train-test split
4. Model training
5. Prediction
6. Evaluation

## ✅ Housing Dataset Example
- Features: house attributes
- Label: house price
- Algorithm: Linear Regression

---

## ✅ Train-Test Split
Dataset divided into:
- Training data (80%)
- Testing data (20%)

Purpose: evaluate model performance
