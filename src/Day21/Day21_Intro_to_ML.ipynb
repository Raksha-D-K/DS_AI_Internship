    "Machine Learning is a way of teaching computers to learn patterns from data instead of following fixed instructions written by a programmer. In traditional programming, developers provide both the rules and the data to produce answers, but in Machine Learning, the computer is given data along with correct outputs so it can automatically discover the underlying rules. This allows systems to improve their performance over time and make predictions or decisions on new data, such as recommending products, recognizing images, or detecting spam emails."
